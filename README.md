### Installing python dependencies locally

In order for VSCode's built in code completion and intelligence to
work correctly, it needs the dependencies from the requirements.txt file
installed. We do this inside docker, but not in the workspace.

So we need to create a virtual environment and pip install the requirements.

From inside the `api` folder:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Then activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

And finally install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then make sure the venv is selected in VSCode by checking the lower right of the
VSCode status bar

### INSTALL

Make seure to change the file ".env.sample" to ".env"

Go into the newly renamed ".env" file and change the quoted information to your needs

Create a volume called "pg-admin" from the root directory in your terminal by using command "docker volume create pg-admin"

### Setup GitLab repo/project

-   make sure this project is in a group. If it isn't, stop
    now and move it to a GitLab group
-   remove the fork relationship: In GitLab go to:

    Settings -> General -> Advanced -> Remove fork relationship

-   add these GitLab CI/CD variables:
    -   PUBLIC_URL : this is your gitlab pages URL
    -   VITE_APP_API_HOST: enter "blank" for now

#### Your GitLab pages URL

You can't find this in GitLab until after you've done a deploy
but you can figure it out yourself from your GitLab project URL.

If this is your project URL

https://gitlab.com/GROUP_NAME/PROJECT_NAME

then your GitLab pages URL will be

https://GROUP_NAME.gitlab.io/PROJECT_NAME
